/**
 * src/main.ts
 * -----------
 * The wiring. This is the ONLY place that connects a concrete core to the
 * client. Right now the core is local (it runs in the same browser tab), but
 * because the client only talks to it through the `CoreBridge` seam below,
 * a future multiplayer build can swap this out for a network connection that
 * sends the same intents to a server and receives the same state back — with
 * NO changes to the core or the client (that's the whole point of RULE 2).
 *
 * Startup flow: a local "log in" screen picks (or creates) a character account;
 * a new character goes through the colour creator first. Only then is the world
 * built and the chosen save laid onto it.
