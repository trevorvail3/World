 * grove, a rock outcrop, a lake and Aldric's farmstead. The six wilderness
 * regions ring the city and keep the exact internal layout they always had;
 * their coordinates here were translated as whole blocks to their new homes
 * (see REGION_OFFSET in map.ts), so every node sits on the same terrain as before.
