/**
 * src/content/spells.ts
 * ---------------------
 * The Devotion spellbook — one page, mixing attack and utility casts. Every spell
 * spends Grace (refilled only at shrines/altars or via a Devotion Potion) and is
 * gated by a Devotion level. The basic staff bolt is free and handled in combat;
 * these are the Grace-fuelled specials you layer on top.
 *
 * Pure DATA. The core (src/core/worldCore.ts `castSpell`) reads `kind` and the
 * matching effect fields; the client renders the list in the Spells tab.
