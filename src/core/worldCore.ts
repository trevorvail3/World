/**
 * src/core/worldCore.ts
 * ---------------------
 * The pure "rules engine" of Varath World.
 *
 * RULE 1 — PURITY: there is no DOM, no Date.now(), no Math.random() in this
 * file. The current time and a random-number generator arrive through the
 * `Ctx` argument. That makes the core deterministic: feed it the same inputs
 * and it produces the same outputs, which is exactly what a multiplayer
 * server needs to keep every player in sync.
 *
 * RULE 2 — INTENTS: the only ways to change the world are `applyIntent`
 * (the player asked for something) and `tick` (time passed). Both return a
 * list of WorldEvents describing what happened, so the client can react
 * (log lines, dialogue, hit-splats) without ever touching state itself.
 *
 * RULE 3 — CONTENT IS DATA: all the numbers that describe *what exists*
 * (the map, items, XP curve, where things spawn) come in via the `Content`
 * bundle. This file only holds the *behaviour*.
