/**
 * src/client/loop.ts
 * ------------------
 * The client game loop and all input handling.
 *
 * The loop's job each frame: read the clock, ask the core to advance time
 * (tick), react to the events the core returns (log lines, dialogue, hit
 * numbers), move the camera, and paint. Taps are turned into INTENTS and
 * handed to the core — the loop NEVER edits world state itself (RULE 2).
 *
 * Input is OSRS-flavoured:
 *   - a short tap does the obvious thing (walk there / interact with that),
 *   - a long press (or right-click) opens an action menu (Interact / Walk
 *     here / Examine),
 *   - a marker shows where you tapped, and the thing you're busy with glows.
