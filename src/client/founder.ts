/**
 * src/client/founder.ts
 * ---------------------
 * The Founder's Pack — the game side of a one-time cosmetic supporter purchase.
 *
 * ENTITLEMENT (who is a founder): a per-account fact, server-authoritative. The
 * source of truth is a `world_entitlements` row in Supabase, written by the
 * Stripe webhook when a supporter pays (see FOUNDER.md). `loadFounderEntitlement`
 * reads it at login and caches the answer; `founderEntitled()` reports it. Until
 * Stripe is wired, a `?founder=1` URL flag stands in so the pack can be built,
 * seen and tested — that dev override is documented and goes away at launch.
 *
 * The entitlement is stamped onto the player as the `"founder"` flag in main.ts's
 * boot(); the CLAIM (handing over the actual cosmetics, once) lives in the core
 * as the FOUNDER_CLAIM intent. This module only reads the entitlement and shows
 * the claim window.
 *
 * COSMETIC ONLY. The pack grants a pet and a cape with no stats and nothing that
 * touches XP, gold, or the leaderboards. The value is "I was here at the start."
