/**
 * src/client/guide.ts
 * -------------------
 * The onboarding coach — two layers, one banner.
 *
 * 1) THE OPENING COACH. For a brand-new player it teaches one system at a time,
 *    exactly when the opening quest ("Ash and Knuckle") makes that system
 *    matter: talk to a quest-giver, gather and train a skill, use a crafting
 *    station, deliver, then graduate into the tabs, the run toggle and combat.
 *    It is driven by the player's quest progress, so it can never get out of
 *    step. When the first quest ends it retires for good.
 *
 * 2) CONTEXTUAL TIPS. Varath has far more systems than the first quest touches —
 *    ranged combat, Faith/magic, farming, cooking, banking, Grace. Rather than
 *    front-load all of that, a set of one-shot tips fire the FIRST time the
 *    player's state shows they've met a system (a bow in the pack, bones to
 *    bury, a staff to wield, an empty Grace bar…). Each fires once, is
 *    remembered in localStorage so it never nags across sessions, and — via a
 *    one-time grandfather check — existing veterans are opted out entirely so
 *    they never get taught what they already know.
 *
 * Presentation only: it reads state and shows a single banner. It never mutates
 * the world.
