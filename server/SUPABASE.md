# World shared leaderboard — Supabase setup (one-time, ~2 minutes)

World reuses your **existing Supabase project** (the same one the idle game uses
for sign-in). Players sign into World with the **same email + password**, and
their scores attach to their real account. You only need to create one table.

The project URL and publishable key are already baked into the game
(`src/client/supabase.ts`) — they're public by design; security is the
Row-Level-Security (RLS) rules below.

## Create the table + security rules

1. Open your Supabase dashboard → **SQL Editor** → **New query**.
2. Paste **all** of this and click **Run**:

```sql
-- One row per signed-in user: their best World character's stats.
create table if not exists public.world_hiscores (
  user_id       uuid primary key references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  name          text not null,
  total_level   integer not null default 0,
  combat        integer not null default 0,
  play_ms       bigint  not null default 0,
  diaries       integer not null default 0,
  monsters_slain integer not null default 0,
  gold_earned   bigint  not null default 0,
  skills        jsonb   not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  updated_at    timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- If the table already exists from an earlier version, add the skills column.
alter table public.world_hiscores
  add column if not exists skills jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb;

-- Turn on Row-Level Security and define who can do what.
alter table public.world_hiscores enable row level security;

-- Anyone (even signed-out) can READ the board.
drop policy if exists "world_hiscores_read" on public.world_hiscores;
create policy "world_hiscores_read"
  on public.world_hiscores for select
  using (true);

-- You can INSERT only your own row.
drop policy if exists "world_hiscores_insert_own" on public.world_hiscores;
create policy "world_hiscores_insert_own"
  on public.world_hiscores for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- You can UPDATE only your own row (the upsert path).
drop policy if exists "world_hiscores_update_own" on public.world_hiscores;
create policy "world_hiscores_update_own"
  on public.world_hiscores for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id)
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

That's it. Open the game → **World** tab → **Hiscores** → **Sign in** with your
idle-game account. Your stats upload each time you open the board, and the
rankings are shared with everyone who plays World.

## Cloud saves — second table (run this too)

So a character follows your account to any device, add the saves table. Same SQL
editor, paste and **Run**:

```sql
-- One row per signed-in user: their character's full save blob.
create table if not exists public.world_saves (
  user_id    uuid primary key references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  name       text,
  data       jsonb not null,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.world_saves enable row level security;

-- Saves are PRIVATE: you can only read your own.
drop policy if exists "world_saves_read_own" on public.world_saves;
create policy "world_saves_read_own"
  on public.world_saves for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- And only write/replace/delete your own.
drop policy if exists "world_saves_insert_own" on public.world_saves;
create policy "world_saves_insert_own"
  on public.world_saves for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

drop policy if exists "world_saves_update_own" on public.world_saves;
create policy "world_saves_update_own"
  on public.world_saves for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id)
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

drop policy if exists "world_saves_delete_own" on public.world_saves;
create policy "world_saves_delete_own"
  on public.world_saves for delete
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Now your character loads from the cloud at sign-in and uploads as you play. Sign
in on another device and the same character is there. (Unlike the hiscores
board, saves are private — the RLS rules above let you read only your own.)

## Ghosts — third table (run this too)

So you can see other signed-in players moving around the world as translucent
"ghosts". Each player publishes a lightweight presence (position + look + zone);
everyone reads the recent ones for their area. Same SQL editor, paste and **Run**:

```sql
-- One row per signed-in user: where they are right now.
create table if not exists public.world_presence (
  user_id    uuid primary key references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  name       text,
  x          double precision not null default 0,
  y          double precision not null default 0,
  zone       text not null default 'overworld',
  look       jsonb,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.world_presence enable row level security;

-- Anyone signed in can SEE everyone's presence (that's the point of ghosts).
drop policy if exists "world_presence_read" on public.world_presence;
create policy "world_presence_read"
  on public.world_presence for select
  using (true);

-- But you can only write/replace your own position.
drop policy if exists "world_presence_insert_own" on public.world_presence;
create policy "world_presence_insert_own"
  on public.world_presence for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

drop policy if exists "world_presence_update_own" on public.world_presence;
create policy "world_presence_update_own"
  on public.world_presence for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id)
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Now when two signed-in players are in the same area, they'll see each other as
faint figures with name labels. (Players inside their own house don't show to
others — interiors are private instances.)

## Grand Exchange — the marketplace (run this block too)

A player-driven order book with a server-held escrow: gold/items you list move
into Exchange tables, and trades settle atomically in the database so there are
no dupes or half-trades, even when both players are offline. Paste and **Run**
the whole block:

```sql

That's the marketplace. In the game: **World → Grand Exchange**. Deposit gold/items
into your Exchange account, place buy/sell offers, and trades settle automatically
against everyone else's offers — including super-rare items at whatever price the
market will bear.

## How it works
- **Read** is public: anyone can see the rankings, even before signing in.
- **Write** is locked to the owner: the RLS rules mean a signed-in user can only
  create/update *their own* row — no one can overwrite someone else's score.
- One row per user (`user_id` primary key), upserted on each board open, so the
  board always reflects each player's latest character.

## Notes
- Uses the project's **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`), which is safe in
  the browser. The secret `service_role` key is never used by the game.
- If sign-up says "check your email", your project has email confirmation on
  (Supabase default). Existing idle-game accounts just **sign in** — no
  confirmation needed.

## Friends (run this for the Players panel)

Lets players add each other as friends and see who's online. Names resolve via
the presence table, so no extra profile table is needed. Paste and **Run**:

```sql
create table if not exists public.friendships (
  id         bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  requester  uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  addressee  uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  status     text not null default 'pending' check (status in ('pending','accepted')),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  unique (requester, addressee)
);
create index if not exists friendships_addressee on public.friendships (addressee);

alter table public.friendships enable row level security;

-- You can see any friendship you're part of.
drop policy if exists friendships_read on public.friendships;
create policy friendships_read on public.friendships for select
  using (auth.uid() = requester or auth.uid() = addressee);

-- You can send a request (as yourself, to someone else).
drop policy if exists friendships_insert on public.friendships;
create policy friendships_insert on public.friendships for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = requester and requester <> addressee);

-- The addressee can accept (update status).
drop policy if exists friendships_update on public.friendships;
create policy friendships_update on public.friendships for update
  using (auth.uid() = addressee) with check (auth.uid() = addressee);

-- Either side can remove/cancel the friendship.
drop policy if exists friendships_delete on public.friendships;
create policy friendships_delete on public.friendships for delete
  using (auth.uid() = requester or auth.uid() = addressee);
```

## World chat (run this for the chat box)

A single shared channel. Paste and **Run**:

```sql
create table if not exists public.world_chat (
  id      bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  name    text,
  body    text not null check (char_length(body) between 1 and 200),
  at      timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index if not exists world_chat_at on public.world_chat (at desc);

alter table public.world_chat enable row level security;

-- Anyone signed in can read the channel.
drop policy if exists world_chat_read on public.world_chat;
create policy world_chat_read on public.world_chat for select using (true);

-- You can post only as yourself, within the length limit.
drop policy if exists world_chat_insert on public.world_chat;
create policy world_chat_insert on public.world_chat for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id and char_length(body) between 1 and 200);
```

(Optional housekeeping: in the dashboard you can later add a scheduled job to
delete chat older than a few days — not required to play.)

## Player trading (run this for the live trade window)

Lets two players trade face-to-face: items + gold each way, gifts allowed, no
fee. The row is just the meeting point — goods live in each player's own save
(same trust model as the Exchange), so when both sides accept, each client
applies its own half of the swap. All changes go through the functions below so
each player can only touch their own side, and an accept can't sneak through
after the offer changed (the `rev` guard). Paste and **Run**:

```sql
create table if not exists public.trades (
  id         bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  a_user     uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  b_user     uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  a_name     text,
  b_name     text,
  a_items    jsonb not null default '[]',
  b_items    jsonb not null default '[]',
  a_gold     bigint not null default 0,
  b_gold     bigint not null default 0,
  a_ok       boolean not null default false,
  b_ok       boolean not null default false,
  a_done     boolean not null default false,
  b_done     boolean not null default false,
  rev        bigint not null default 0,
  status     text not null default 'offered'
             check (status in ('offered','active','settled','cancelled')),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index if not exists trades_parties on public.trades (a_user, b_user, status);
